# Space-Invasion-iOS
Retro spaceship simulator game built with SpriteKit.

The project was started - and also archived - in 2018, my second attempt at developing a game for the platform after my first ever Swift project - Cups, 2016.

Maneuver the spaceship through a stream of aliens. The spaceship is equippped with a laser cannon and score is growing with the number of aliens hit during the flight. When colliding with aliens, health is dropped by one heart until it runs out completely, meaning the end of the game.
